### CURRENT STAGE OF THIS DOCUMENT: Rapidly changing (again), possibly incomplete, likely brittle do to lots of automation based on this specific configuration
#### Last updated: 2019.12.10, early AM PDT

CAUTION: The procedure outlined in this document leverages AutoYaST. AutoYaST works slightly differently depending on if the server is configured to boot in (U)EFI mode or Legacy BIOS mode. This document attempts to provide the simplest procedures for both cases. 

#### This document is a strictly guided, step-by-step implementation of a specific configuration based on the CaaS Platform v4.0.0 Deployment Guide: https://documentation.suse.com/suse-caasp/4/single-html/caasp-deployment/
* This specific configuration is based on eight nodes:
** Management Workstation - VM 
** Three CaaS Platform Master Nodes - Dell R640 hosts
** Four CaaS Platform Worker Nodes - Dell R740 hosts

.Overview of this installation procedure:
* Create a CaaS Platform Management Workstation VM and manually install the SLES15 SP1
* Manually install SLES15 SP1 on one of the Dell R640 and one of the Dell R740 hosts and configure bonded networks, as appropriate
* Make an AutoYaST clone file of each of the Dell hosts
* AutoYaST install the remaining nodes from the Dell R640 and Dell R740 AutoYaST files, as appropriate
* Prepare the nodes for forming the CaaS Platform cluster
* Form the CaaS Platform cluster
* Update the CaaS Platform cluster as needed for the application

NOTE: Unlike CaaS Platform v3, the Management Workstation for CaaS Platform v4 is not tied in a 1:1 relationship with the CaaS Platform cluster.
      A Management Workstation can be used to deploy one or more CaaS Platform clusters and a CaaS Platform cluster can be managed from the 
      Management Workstation that deployed it and/or another appropriately configured Management Workstation.

CAUTION: This guide can be used as a reference while deploying different configurations, but deviating from the specified design can cause unpredicable results


.Required preparation before beginning
* Establish an IP schema for the cluster. 
* Populate DNS records that are available to the cluster nodes
* A local RMT registration server

### Install the Management Workstation:

* Virtual Machine connected to a bridge that has access to the Internet and the cluster network
* 4 vCPU, 4096MB mem, 20GB qcow2 boot drive in default libvirt location
* Booting from ISO: Select "Installation" BUT DO NOT PRESS ENTER
* On "Boot Options:" line: `ifcfg=eth0=172.29.145.53/24,172.29.145.2,172.29.202.10,suse.hpc.local hostname=kubeadmin.suse.hpc.local`
** Format of ifcfg=eth0= is <node IP address/cidr mask>,<default gateway>,<primary DNS server>,<search domain>
* Press Enter
* Register with the RMT server and select the SUSE CaaS Platform 4.0 module (May need to uncheck "Hide Development Modules")
* For partitioning, select Guided Setup
** A separate Home Partition is not needed on any of the CaaS Platform Nodes but can be configured, if desired
** Keep defaults except deselect "Propose Separate Swap Partition"

NOTE: Swap will likely not be needed for the Management Workstation. Swap can be used on the Management Workstations but it CANNOT be used on the CaaS Platform nodes. Swap is incompatible with Kubernetes.

* Create New User:
** User's Full Name and Username: geeko

IMPORTANT: It is recommended to use a secure password that will work with all elements of the PoC environment. Therefore a password should be selected that includes at least one upper case and one lower case letter, one number and at least one of the following three special characters: ! # $

** Select "Use this password for system administrator" 
* On the final "Installation Settings" screen:
** Under Security, disable the Firewall
* Install


.Finish preparing the Management workstation:
* Enable passwordless sudo for the user geeko
----
sudo bash -c "echo 'geeko ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL' >> /etc/sudoers.d/01geeko"
----
* The eaisest way to insert the Management Workstation's SSH key into the AutoYaST clone file is to add it to itself before creating the clone file
** `ssh-keygen`
*** Accept the defaults, though a passphrase can be configured here, if desired
** `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
* Update the NTP client settings. 
** `sudo yast timezone`
*** `other Settings`
*** `Synchronize with NTP server`
*** Enter `172.29.202.15` under `NTP Server Access`
*** `Synchronize now`
**** Synchronizing with the NTP service will take several seconds but should complete without error
*** `Run NTP as daemon`
*** `Save NTP Configuration`
*** `Accept`, then `OK`

.Create a file to reference all of the CaaS Platform cluster nodes
* `mkdir ~/autoyast_templates`
----
cat <<EOF> ~/autoyast_templates/.all_nodes
mstr1.suse.hpc.local
mstr2.suse.hpc.local
mstr3.suse.hpc.local
wrkr1.suse.hpc.local
wrkr2.suse.hpc.local
wrkr3.suse.hpc.local
wrkr4.suse.hpc.local
EOF
----

### Setup podman and the nginx webserver

** `sudo zypper -n in podman`
** Launch nginx webserver container: `sudo podman run --name autoyast-nginx -v /home/geeko/autoyast_templates:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro -P -d nginx:latest`

IMPORTANT: This container WILL NOT automatically start after rebooting the Management Workstation. Use `sudo podman start autoyast-nginx` to start it manually

* Find the network port used by the nginx container:
** `sudo podman ps`
*** The port will listed under PORTS. For example, port 32768 would be indicated with: `0.0.0.0:32768->80/tcp`
* Set this variable to the nginx port: `NGINX_PORT=""`
* Test that files in the autoyast_templates directory are available: `curl http://kubeadmin.suse.hpc.local:$NGINX_PORT/.all_nodes`
** The output should display the entire ses-osd-c.xml file
*** To verify the output, compare the md5sum from each of the following two commands:
**** `md5sum autoyast_templates/master.xml`
**** `curl http://ses-admin.stable.suse.lab:$NGINX_PORT/master.xml | md5sum`

.Update the master.xml AutoYaST file with the correct hostname and IP address
* `sudo zypper -n in xmlstarlet`
* `cd ~/autoyast_templates/`
* Verify that getent returns the correct IP address and fully qualified hostname 
** `getent hosts master`

WARNING: If the getent command does not return the correct IP address and fully qualified hostanme, DO NOT run the following `xml ed` and `sed` commands

* Update hostname in the master.xml file: `xml ed -L -u "//_:networking/_:dns/_:hostname" -v master master.xml`

TIP: Use the command `grep ipaddr autoinst.xml` to verify the Management Workstation's IP address

** Set this variable to the Management Workstation's IP address (i.e. 172.16.241.105): `MANAGEMENTIP=""`
----
MASTERIP=`getent hosts master | awk '{print$1}'`; sed -i "s/$MANAGEMENTIP/$MASTERIP/" master.xml
----


IMPORTANT: In this procedure, AutoYaST will initially install the Master Node with the same network configuration as the Management Workstation. After the installation, the network will be manually changed to the Master Node's installed configuration. That configuration will be captured and used to AutoYaST install the Worker Nodes. If the Management Workstation's installed network configuration is not compatible with the Master Node's network capabilities (i.e. the Management Workstation uses eth0 but eth0 on the Master Node is not connect to the network), it is recommended to either edit the AutoYast file to create the Master Node's installed network configuration, or install the Master Node manually. See the AutoYaST guide for more information: https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP1/single-html/SLES-autoyast/#book-autoyast

.Update the master.xml AutoYaST file based on architectural differences:
* If the Master Node is a bare-metal host, run this command: 
----
xml ed -L -d "//_:services-manager/_:services/_:enable/_:service[text()='spice-vdagentd']"  master.xml
----
* If the Master Node boots in Legacy BIOS mode, run this command: `xml ed -L -u "//_:bootloader/_:loader_type" -v grub2 master.xml`
* If the Master Node boots in (U)EFI mode, run this command: `xml ed -L -u "//_:bootloader/_:loader_type" -v grub2-efi master.xml`

////
.Create an AutoYaST clone file of the Management Workstation
* `sudo yast2 clone_system`
** Approve the installation of the autoyast2 package
* `mkdir ~/autoyast_templates`
* `sudo mv /root/autoinst.xml ~/autoyast_templates/`
* `sudo chown -R geeko:users ~/autoyast_templates/`
* `cp ~/autoyast_templates/autoinst.xml ~/autoyast_templates/ses-osd-c.xml`
////

////
Manual way of updating hostname and IP address
*** `cd autoyast_templates/; vim master.xml`
**** Search for <\/hostname
***** Change hostname from admin to master
**** Search for `<ipaddr`
***** Change the IP address to that of the master. In this document it is 172.16.241.105
////

.Update the correct boot drive for the Master Node

CAUTION: The following steps assume that the first drive to be probed is the Master Node's boot drive. If this is not the case, edit the AutoYaST file manually to set the correct boot drive

** If the Master Node is a VM, run this command: `xml ed -L -u "//_:partitioning/_:drive/_:device"[1] -v "/dev/vda" master.xml`
** If the Master Node is a bare-metal server, run this command: `xml ed -L -u "//_:partitioning/_:drive/_:device"[1] -v "/dev/sda" master.xml`
* `cd ~/autoyast_templates/; vim master.xml`
* Fill the root partition with all of the remaining space on the boot drive:
** To find the <partition> element for the root partition, search for the string `<mount>\/<`
*** Inside that <partition> element (normally below the <mount> subnode), change the value of the <size> subnode to `max`
**** For example, before the change it might look like: `<size>66561507328</size>` and after the change it will look like: `<size>max</size>`

.AutoYaST install the Master Node

IMPORTANT: The procedure for installing via AutoYaST is slightly different depending on if the target server is configured to boot in (U)EFI mode or Legacy BIOS mode. Be sure to verify the boot mode for a bare-metal server before continuing. Virtual Machines commonly boot in Legacy BIOS mode. For more information, see the SLES15 SP1 AutoYaST guide: https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP1/single-html/SLES-autoyast/#book-autoyast

CAUTION: The steps below assume the Master Node's eth0 has network access to the admin node. If this is not the case, asjusted the "AutoYaST parameters" line below to specify a NIC on the Master Node that has network access to the admin node.

* Provide the SLES 15 SP1 DVD1 installer DVD or ISO to the BIOS of the Master Node
* Start the Master Node from DVD or ISO,  Select "Installation" at the DVD GRuB screen, but DO NOT PRESS ENTER
** If there is a "Boot Options" line near the bottom of the screen, provide the AutoYaST parameters, shown below. When ready, press Enter to boot the system.
** If there IS NOT a "Boot Options" line near the bottom of the screen, press the "e" key. Then, provide the AutoYaST parameters shown below, at the end of the "linuxefi" line (Be sure to insert a space after "splash=silent"). When ready, press Ctrl+x to boot the system.
*** AutoYaST parameters: `autoyast=http://kubeadmin.suse.hpc.local:<nginx port>/master.xml ifcfg=eth0=<IP of master>/24,<IP of gateway>,<IP of DNS server>,suse.hpc.local hostname=master.suse.hpc.local`

.After Master Node completes installation, Adjust its networking to suit the environment 

NOTE: This document demonstrates the procdure for creating a bonded network from eth0
    and eth1, then assigning the node's IP address to that bond; however, your configuration may be different

** VM based CaaS Platform nodes will likely not need any network modifications
* Perform the following steps from the Master Node's console:

TIP: In yast, Tab will help you navigate through panes and options. Each option in yast will have a letter highlighted.
     Using "Alt" + that letter will directly open that option.

** `sudo yast lan`
** `(Use tab and the arrow keys to highlight eth0) -> Delete -> OK`
** `sudo yast lan`
** `Add -> Device Type -> Bond -> Next`
** `(Select Statically Assigned IP Address) -> IP Address -> (input the Master Node's IP address)`
** `(Adjust the Subnet Mask, if needed) -> Bonded Slaves -> Yes`
** `(Select both eth0 and eth1) -> Next`
** `Routing -> (Ensure the Device for Default IPv4 Gateway is "-") -> OK`
* Verify networking is functioning correctly:
** `ip a`
** `ping opensuse.com`

.Ensure the Master Node does not have swap enabled. Swap is incompatible with Kubernetes
* `cat /proc/swaps`
** Should return a header line, but nothing else
* `grep swap /etc/fstab`
** Should return nothing
*** If swap is enabled, remote the swap line from the /etc/fstab file and reboot

.Add Master Node SSH key to its own authorized_keys file so it will be included in the AutoYaST clone file
* `ssh-keygen`
** Accept the defaults
* `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`

.Creating an AutoYaST clone of the Master Node
** The following steps can be performed from the Master Node's console or an SSH session
*** `sudo yast2 clone_system`
*** SCP the AutoYaST file to the Management Workstation. This will overwrite the original master.xml file. Make a copy first, if needed.
**** ` sudo scp /root/autoinst.xml kubeadmin.suse.hpc.local:/home/geeko/autoyast_templates/master.xml `

.Create copies of the master.xml file for each Worker Node

TIP: Perform the following steps from the Management Workstation as the geeko user

* `cd ~/autoyast_templates/`
* `for EACH in 1 2 3; do cp -p master.xml worker$EACH.xml; done`

.Edit each Worker Node XML file to update the hostname and IP address
////
Note: Due to the "<profile xmlns=" default namespace declaration in the AutoYaST file, xmlstarlet selects and edits follow a different format:
To select the hostname: xml sel -t -m "//_:networking/_:dns" -v _:hostname FILENAME.xml
To update the hostname: xml ed -L -u "//_:networking/_:dns/_:hostname" -v <new hostname> FILENAME.xml
////

* Change the hostname value for each Worker Node
** `for EACH in 1 2 3; do xml ed -L -u "//_:networking/_:dns/_:hostname" -v worker$EACH worker$EACH.xml; done`
* Verify that getent returns the correct IP addresses and hostnames. If not, DO NOT run the subsequent xml ed for loop
** `for EACH in 1 2 3; do getent hosts worker$EACH; done`
* Change the ipaddr value for each Worker Node's external interface
** Set this variable to the Master Node's IP address: `MASTERIP=""`
** `for EACH in 1 2 3; do WORKERIP=`getent hosts worker$EACH | awk '{print$1}'`; sed -i "s/$MASTERIP/$WORKERIP/" worker$EACH.xml; done`

////
This was the manual way to update hostname and IP address
** `for EACH in 1 2 3; do vim worker$EACH.xml; done`
*** Search for <\/hostname
**** Change hostname from master to the correct Worker Node name
*** Search for <ipaddr
**** Change the IP address to that of the correct Worker Node
*** Use the command `:x` to save the file and move on the the next
////

.Test that each Worker Node XML file is available through the nginx webserver
* `docker ps`
* Set this variable to the port listed under PORTS: `NGINX_PORT=""`
* Test that each Worker Node autoyast file is available: `for EACH in 1 2 3; do curl http://kubeadmin.suse.hpc.local:$NGINX_PORT/worker$EACH.xml | egrep "<hostname|ipaddr"; done`
** Verify each hostname and IP address is correct for each Worker Node

.AutoYaST install worker1

IMPORTANT: The procedure for installing via AutoYaST is slightly different depending on if the target server is configured to boot in (U)EFI mode or Legacy BIOS mode. To ensure a the boot mode for a bare-metal server, consult its BIOS before continuing. Virtual Machines commonly boot in Legacy BIOS mode. For more information, see the SLES15 SP1 AutoYaST guide: https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP1/single-html/SLES-autoyast/#book-autoyast

TIP: It is recommended to fully install worker1 before continuing to the rest of the Worker Nodes.
     Once it is shown that worker1 can be fully installed with the AutoYaST configuration, multiple Worker Nodes can be installed simultaneously.

* Provide the SLES 15 SP1 DVD1 installer DVD or ISO to the VM or host BIOS
* Start the worker1 from DVD ISO,  Select "Installation" at DVD GRuB screen, but DO NOT PRESS ENTER
** If there is a "Boot Options" line near the bottom of the screen, provide the AutoYaST parameters, shown below. When ready, press Enter to boot the system.
** If there IS NOT a "Boot Options" line near the bottom of the screen, press the "e" key, then provide the AutoYaST parameters, shown below; at the end of the "linuxefi" line. When ready, press Ctrl+x to boot the system.
*** AutoYaST parameters: `autoyast=http://kubeadmin.suse.hpc.local:<nginx port>/<worker node name>.xml ifcfg=eth0=<IP of worker node>/24,<IP of gateway>,<IP of DNS server>,suse.hpc.local hostname=<worker node name>.suse.hpc.local

.AutoYaST install the rest of the Worker Nodes
* Repeat the previous step, "AutoYast install worker1" for each of the remaining Worker Nodes

### Preparation for forming CaaS Platform cluster

NOTE: The following commands should be run from the Management Workstation and require a .all_nodes file that contains the fully qualified hostnames of all cluster nodes. Create this file if it doesn't already, before continuing.
 
* `eval "$(ssh-agent)"`
* `ssh-add /home/geeko/.ssh/id_rsa`
* Verify passwordless SSH and sudo capabilities for the geeko user on all nodes
----
for EACH in `cat .all_nodes`; do ssh $EACH sudo hostname -f; done
----
** It should return each fully qualified hostname with no additional interaction required

.Ensure caasp, SLES, basesystem, and containers are all "Registered"
----
for EACH in `cat .all_nodes`; do echo $EACH; ssh $EACH sudo SUSEConnect -s | egrep --color "caasp|SLES|basesystem|containers|\"Registered\"" && echo"" && echo "Press Enter for next system" && read NEXT; done
----

.Ensure swap is not enabled on any of the CaaS Platform hosts
----
for EACH in `cat .all_nodes`; do echo $EACH; ssh $EACH cat /proc/swaps; echo ""; done
----
** Should return a header line for each node, but nothing else

### Form the CaaS Platform cluster

.For any VM nodes, snapshot before instantiating the cluster
* Create snapshot
----
for EACH in `cat .all_nodes`; do echo $EACH; ssh $EACH sudo virsh snapshot-create-as $EACH --name "before forming cluster"; echo ""; done
----

.Bootstrap the cluster
* On the Management Workstation:
* `sudo zypper -n install -t pattern SUSE-CaaSP-Management`
* `skuba cluster init --control-plane mstr.suse.hpc.local suse-caasp-hpc`
** Note: --control-plane defines the FQDN of the load balancer. The second argument is the name of the cluster.
* Ensure the SSH Agent is running and has the geeko user's RSA key loaded
** `ps -ef | grep ssh-agent`
*** If this doesn't return an ssh-agent running for the geeko user, run the following commands to start ssh-agent and add the Management Workstation's key:
**** `eval "$(ssh-agent)"`
**** `ssh-add /home/geeko/.ssh/id_rsa`
* `cd /home/geeko/suse-caasp-hpc`
* `skuba node bootstrap --user geeko --sudo --target mstr1.suse.hpc.local mstr1`
** Note this command bootstraps the CaaS Platform cluster with mstr1.suse.hpc.local as the first master node. Internally, Kubernetes will assign this node the name "mstr1"

.Join the remaining Master Nodes to the cluster
----
for MASTER_FQDN in `grep mstr .all_nodes | tail -n+2`; do \
MASTER=`echo $MASTER_FQDN | awk -F. '{print$1}'`; \
skuba node join --role master --user geeko --sudo \
--target $MASTER_FQDN $MASTER; \
done
----

.Join the Worker Nodes to the cluster
----
for WORKER_FQDN in `grep wrkr .all_nodes`; do \
WORKER=`echo $WORKER_FQDN | awk -F. '{print$1}'`; \
skuba node join --role worker --user geeko --sudo \
--target $WORKER_FQDN $WORKER; \
done
----

.Verify the status of the cluster
* `cd /home/geeko/suse-caasp-hpc`
* `skuba cluster status`

.Enable the use of kubectl from the Management Workstation
* `echo export KUBECONFIG=/home/geeko/caaspv4-cluster/admin.conf >> ~/.bashrc`
* `. ~/.bashrc` 
* `kubectl get nodes`

.For any VM nodes, snapshot immediately after instantiating the cluster
* Create snapshot script
----
cat <<EOF> /tmp/snap_after_cluster.sh
/bin/bash
sudo virsh list --all | grep "suse.hpc.local" | awk '{print$2}' > /tmp/k8s_nodes
for K8S_NODE in `cat /tmp/k8s_nodes`; do sudo virsh snapshot-create-as \$K8S_NODE --name "after forming cluster"; done
EOF
----

* scp the script to each node and execute it
----
for EACH in `cat .all_kvm_hosts`; do \
echo $EACH; scp /tmp/snap_after_cluster.sh $EACH:/tmp; \
ssh $EACH /tmp/snap_after_cluster.sh ; echo ""; \
done
----

### Configure Dex and Gangway

.Create the ClusterRoleBinding for the admins group
* `kubectl create clusterrolebinding ldap-admin-access --clusterrole=cluster-admin --group=admins`
* Edit the configmap: `kubectl --namespace=kube-system edit configmap oidc-dex-config`
* Restart Dex and Gangway pods:
----
kubectl --namespace=kube-system delete pod -l app=oidc-dex
kubectl --namespace=kube-system delete pod -l app=oidc-gangway
----
* Verify the new pods have started correctly: 
----
kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l app=oidc-dex
kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l app=oidc-gangway
----

.Add the Dex self-signed cert to the Admin node:
* Get the cert from the dex pod: `kubectl exec -it -n kube-system $(kubectl get pod -n kube-system -l app=oidc-dex -o name | head -1) cat /etc/dex/pki/ca.crt > /tmp/mstr.suse.hpc.local:32000-ca.crt`
* Move the cert into place: `sudo mv /tmp/mstr.suse.hpc.local:32000-ca.crt /etc/pki/trust/anchors/`
* Update the certs: `sudo update-ca-certificates`

.Test authentication:
* `skuba auth login -s https://mstr.suse.hpc.local:32000`
* Remove the kubeconf.txt file, if the login was successful: `rm kubeconf.txt`
* Use the Chromium browser to test logging into Gangway at https://mstr.suse.hpc.local:32001
** Log in with a user id, such as suse, rather than email address
** Try using Incognito Mode if cookie errors prevent logging in

### Configure the Ceph storage class

### Enable Privilege Escalation

.Edit the pod security policy
* `kubectl edit psp suse.caasp.psp.unprivileged`
* Add the following elements below `spec:`
----
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: true
  allowedCapabilities:
  - SYS_PTRACE
  - NET_ADMIN
----


.Troubleshooting failed bootstrap
* ssh to master and `sudo less /var/log/messages` 
* Search for kub
* Follow the progression of the skuba command and kubeadm
** Generally skuba will install the packages, then launch kubeadm
** kubeadm will set up the K8s components
** If the failure occurs after kubeadm takes over try to replicate the failure:
*** scp kubeadm-init.conf from the cluster directory (caaspv4-cluster in this doc) to /tmp on the master node
*** Run the `kubeadm init` command that is in /var/log/messages
*** kubeadm should give reasonably actionable error messages
